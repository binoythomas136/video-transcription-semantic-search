So he came and told that my class is also over, although he who is a jumper is taught in our school only, in Rajkumar Sir's class, even before the agent, he was assigned to Janmpuran, which since his class is also over, he is asked to do so.  It has also boosted my morale a lot that even though I have done a good institute, whether it is Android or iPhone, repairing has become very difficult and the previous technicians are not able to do it, whether it is Face ID or many other things.

      "0.11:  JavaScript is really weird if I have a  string 11 and then add 1 we get 111 okay  kind of makes sense I guess but if you  do string 11 minus 1 it somehow goes to  10.  okay then even the error handling is a  bit weird if you had a function that  accepts two parameters adding one will  throw an error but adding another one  will just ignore the extra okay then  quick question is an array equal to a  not array  well according to JavaScript it is okay  well how about adding two floats 0.1  plus 0.2 is equal to 0.3 right well  actually it's  0.3000 yeah you get the point okay  that's not just JavaScript that runs  into that issue in fact almost all  programming language has this issue as  well the lesson learned is that every  single programming language has its  weird quirks you just gotta kind of work  with it: 4t_ukSUQdwo \n",
      "0.11:  My condo is pretty simple. I think I’d describe my style as minimal and functional, but I do enjoy my tech here and there. A day in my condo is me waking up in my bed, cooking in the kitchen, relaxing to some shows on the TV and working on my computer in the office. I have a lot of items that are from IKEA, one too many computer desks, and a bunch of little gadgets and technology here and there that make up the rest of my space. Hi I’m David and this is a tech tour of my condo. Stepping in my place you’ll see a little bit of everything from the start. The kitchen to my left, the living room, the office in the back, and bedroom to the right. But let’s start with the main living space. I spend a lot of time here playing video games, watching videos or just relaxing on the sofa. My TV console contains the bulk of my electronics at home. Everything from my modem, router, gaming consoles all tucked away in these drawers. The TV and Speakers are old but the connected Chromecast and Home Theatre PC makes it as powerful as any modern smart system. I also added basic smart lights that change the mood from daylight, to warm night lights, to a dim mode for movie watching. I have complete control for my home theatre with a single Harmony remote and the Harmony hub means I can also control it remotely from my tablet or phone, or I can even use voice control with the nearby Google Home Mini. This Google Home Mini in my kitchen, is perfect to have while cooking, I like to ask it thing like, setting a 15 minute timer, converting 8oz to grams, or even to listen to music. Multi-room playback is my favorite feature with these Google Home Minis, I have another in my office and in the bedroom, combined with a Chromecast Audio on my home theatre speakers means I can keep listening to my tunes no matter which room I’m in. I’m definitely lacking some art pieces and plants around my place, so for now I’ve just hung some of my commonly used backpacks up on the wall making them really accessible to grab each day. And finishing off the living space is my nook for all my chargers and cables. Not the pretty space but I try to hide most of my extra chargers in the ottomans or the extra cables in a box, to keep the space a little more tidy. Next up is my office. Most of my videos are shot in here so things should be pretty familiar. It’s a pretty tight space but I manage to fit two desks in here. One desk for docking my laptop with a couple different mechanical keyboards, and the other for my main rig with the standing desk. A couple other IKEA tabletops tucked in the corner just because. And for the rest of my gear and gadgets I tend to just try to fit them in my closet. Out of sight out of mind. On the other side of my place is my bedroom. I try to avoid putting too much tech in here, since I’m mainly just in here to sleep. But waking up in the mornings can be tough so I have a couple more smart lights to that automatically brighten up the room in the mornings, or I can also use my sunrise alarm clock to do the same. To add to my wake up routine my TV is programmed to automatically turn on and play the local news channel. And I can even ask my other google home mini while half asleep what the weather is today or to play some other music to ease me into my day. So that’s a quick look at my condo currently and some of the tech I use around my place. Sure it lacks some artwork and some plants but it is functional enough for me to get me through my typical day. But hope you guys enjoyed this one. You know what to do. And I’ll see you in the next video. \n",

There, in the settings, you can turn off the file scanning Bluetooth settings, this will improve the wife in the background. Whatever you need on this battery, we all have vibration notes in our phones. If you turn it off, pay attention to a lot of notifications, then all the vibrations, nor does it become too heavy for you, we all keep getting notifications from 34 accounts in our phones. One thing you will do is turn off their setting in the background and since it was only Flipkart and Amazon, you can recognize the new ones on your display, but if you put black wallpaper in it, then wherever there are likes, electricity is wasted and your battery.  6194 is required in very low cases, but if you cut the charges of voice vote, let's reduce the battery to half by hundred percent. If the charge of your 4868 Note is optimized here at night, you can use it in the middle of charging, when it reaches hundred percent.
