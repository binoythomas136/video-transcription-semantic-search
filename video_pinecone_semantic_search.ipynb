      "0.64:  This is a pretty big iPhone 14 plus.  But how big do you think the biggest iPhone in the world is?  So I wasn't expecting this, but YouTuber Matthew Beem told me he was building the world's largest iPhone a few days ago and then he showed up with it.  This thing is fully functional, stands 7 feet tall, and weighs almost 500 pounds. There's an on/off button here.  There are also volume buttons and a mute button.  It's so high that you have to climb a ladder to take a selfie with the camera because it's right up here.  But you know, I'm the tech YouTuber, so I had to do a little digging into how he did it.  And first of all, watch his video to see my full reaction to it.  But it turns out there's no iPhone here.  It's actually a Mac Mini here, which simulates running a virtual Android phone, and then that Android phone is running a launcher that makes it look like an iPhone, all with some improvised technology around the edges to make it see where your  finger is to make it work as a touch screen.  All this to say, it's not an iPhone, technically, but it's still pretty impressive. This is an iPhone 14 Plus and it's pretty big, but what size do you think is the largest iPhone in the world? YouTuber Matthew Beam told me he was building the world's largest iPhone a few days ago and then showed up with it.  It is 2 meters high, weighs 255 kilos and can be used.  It has power and volume buttons and a mute switch. Because it's so tall, you have to climb a ladder to take a selfie. But since I have a tech channel, I had to do a little research on how he did it. Don't forget to watch his video to see my full reaction. It turns out that Matthew's giant creation doesn't have an iPhone. In reality, it's a Mac mini that simulates running a virtual Android phone, and that virtual Android phone runs a launcher that mimics the appearance of an iPhone. Plus, there's plenty of technology around the edges to detect where your finger is and simulate a touch screen. While it's not technically an iPhone, it's pretty impressive. all right so this is an iPhone 14 plus  pretty big phone but how big do you  think the biggest iPhone in the world is  so I wasn't expecting this but YouTuber  Matthew beam told me he was building the  world's biggest iPhone a few days ago  and then he showed up with it this thing  is fully functional seven feet tall and  weighs close to 500 pounds it has a  power button here there's also volume  buttons and a mute switch it's so tall  you have to get up on a ladder to take a  selfie with the camera because it's all  the way up here but you know I am the  tech YouTuber so I kind of had to  investigate a little bit into how he  made this and first of all watch his  video for my full reaction on the thing  but turns out there is no iPhone  actually in here at all it's actually a  Mac Mini in here which simulates running  a virtual Android phone and then that  Android phone is running a launcher that  makes it look like an iPhone all with  some jail rig Tech on the edges to make  it see where your finger is to make it  act like a touch screen all that to say  it's not an iPhone technically but it is  still pretty impressive: FNnK1J-BdiM \n",

So here I searched on Google, brother, two-three phones came in front of me.  But brother, it was going more buttery, it has three cameras each, like iPhone 14, its price was also ₹ 899, so this is also a real winner at ₹ 1503 because it looks exactly like the iPhone and the build quality etc. is exactly like this phone. It has three big eyes along with the updated fingerprint on the side, but you know that this phone is one thing, the head is visible from the primary camera of 50 megapixels due to which the photos are absolutely amazing and in it you get an HD+ 90Hz display.  Due to the color of the display, it looks like a one-piece phone, I am using it with both, its battery backup is very strong and in one hour and 30 minutes this phone gets charged for 02 hours and it is blessed with power from UNICEF.  d6 tu hai agar me aapko mil jati jati hai absolutely butter performance so just be afraid of what I have taken a cheap iPhone you also go and get the rest like subscribe follow: Bhv1LQOwsk4 \n",

      "0.52:  Apple has heavily promoted their trade-in program in recent years, encouraging users to give up their old iPhone in exchange for a discount on a new model. Over a third of Apple Store customers now utilize this program, but its left many people wondering why Apple even wants our old iPhones. Which is what I’ll explain right now. It’s no coincidence that Apple began offering discounts with trade-ins in 2013, when they experienced their first quarterly profit decline in a decade. And started aggressively promoting the trade-in program in 2017, when they released the $1,000 iPhone X. It solved two problems the company faced: Slowing iPhone sales due to market saturation, and users waiting longer to upgrade due to the iPhone’s price rising year after year. Trade-ins bring down the device’s price and allow more users to upgrade sooner. But what does Apple do with all those old iPhones? Well, if it’s in good working condition, they refurbish the device and resell it in emerging markets like India, Latin America and Africa. That way, Apple can directly compete in the used smartphone market while also selling a device twice that only had to be manufactured once. But if the phone is in too poor a condition to sell, Apple recycles it. They actually created a robot called Daisy specifically for this purpose. It’s able to dissemble 200 iPhones an hour while recovering recyclable materials that would otherwise be left in landfills. This approach was required in order to achieve Apple’s goal of a closed-loop supply chain. Where all new products would be manufactured without “pulling new materials from the Earth.” Apple has yet to achieve the goal, but they are taking steps like using 100% recycled rare earth materials in the iPhone 12. So the iPhone trade-in program benefits the customer by making their new device more affordable, benefits Apple by boosting sales of new iPhones plus sales of older refurbished models, and benefits the environment. By allowing devices to be used up to their full potential before being recycled. This is Greg with Apple Explained, thanks for watching till the end, and I’ll see you in the next video.\n",
